        I spend a large portion of my free time learning new technologies for software engineering. Occasionally, this leads to a complete product or application I push out to the public. You can check out some of my more notable ones here.

    <div class="projects">
        {% for project in site.projects %}
            <hr/>
            <section class="showcase">
                <h2><a href="{{ project.link }}" target="_blank" class="nodec">{{ project.title }}</a></h2>

                {{ project.content }}

                <h3 class="center"><a href="{{ project.link }}" target="_blank">View {{ project.title }}'s Showcase</a></h3>
            </section>

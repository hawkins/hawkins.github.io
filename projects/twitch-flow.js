  motive:
    "During my second-to-last semester of school at Mississippi State University, I found that watching Twitch streams in the background on a second monitor was a great way to stay sane and deal with tedium during long homework sessions.",
  learned:
    "This project was a fun way to learn MobX with React.js and integrate the two into an Electron app for use on my MacBook, PC, and Linux computers.<br/>I still use the tool as a reference for teaching others Real-world React, by referencing parts of the app where I solved common trouble-spots such as asynchronous data fetching."

# Hawkins Writes Code

This is the repo powering my tech blog. It's an extension of John Otander's  [pixyll](http://www.pixyll.com) Jekyll theme, powered by GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

If you're completely new to Jekyll, I recommend checking out the documentation at <http://jekyllrb.com> or there's a tutorial by [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

```
$ cd pixyll
$ gem install bundler # If you don't have bundler installed
$ bundle install
```

### Modify the `_config.yml`

The `_config.yml` located in the root directory contains all of the configuration details for the Jekyll site.

### Jekyll Serve

Then, start the Jekyll Server. I always like to give the `--watch` option so it updates the generated HTML when I make changes.

```
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

Now you can navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to see the site.

## Further Pixyll info

### Using Github Pages

You can host your Jekyll site for free with Github Pages. [Click here](https://pages.github.com/) for more information.

#### A configuration tweak if you're using a gh-pages sub-folder

In addition to your github-username.github.io repo that maps to the root url, you can serve up sites by using a gh-pages branch for other repos so they're available at github-username.github.io/repo-name.

This will require you to modify the `_config.yml` like so:

```yml
# Site settings
baseurl: "/repo-name"
url: "http://github-username.github.io"
```

This will ensure that the the correct relative path is constructed for your assets and posts. Also, in order to run the project locally, you will need to specify the blank string for the baseurl: `$ jekyll serve --baseurl ''`.

### Contact Form

The contact form uses <http://formspree.io>. It will require you to fill the form out and submit it once, before going live, to confirm your email.

More setup instructions and advanced options can be found at [http://formspree.io](http://formspree.io/)

### Disqus

To configure Disqus, set up a [Disqus site](https://disqus.com/admin/create/) with the same name as your site. Then, in `_config.yml`, edit the `disqus_shortname` value to enable Disqus.

### Customizing the CSS

All variables can be found in the `_sass/_variables.scss` file, toggle these as you'd like to change the look and feel of Pixyll.

## Upgrading Pixyll

Pixyll is always being improved by its users, so sometimes one may need to upgrade.

#### Ensure there's an upstream remote

If `git remote -v` doesn't have an upstream listed, you can do the following to add it:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll.git
```

#### Pull in the latest changes

```
git pull upstream master
```

There may be merge conflicts, so be sure to fix the files that git lists if they occur. That's it!

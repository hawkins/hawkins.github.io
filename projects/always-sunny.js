  motive:
    "My sister and I are huge fans of the show \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\"<br/>I tend to turn the show on and leave it in the background while programming OSS projects, so I've actually seen every episode from seasons 1-10 at least 13 times, and season 11 many times each, too.<br/>My sister watches it a lot too, so she suggested I make a website to pick and filter episodes to watch based on starring roles and guest characters.",
  learned:
    "With thousands of page views per month and hundreds of regular visitors, I'm extremely proud of the utility I've made out of a hobby project.<br/>I learned how to deal with darker color schemes while targeting a minimal interface, although the responsive layout still leaves some to be desired."

    "Automatically process your source files with Prettier when Webpack runs.",
  motive:
    "During my Game Design course, I wrote a number of games in JavaScript with Phaser.io and Webpack.<br/>When I started experimenting with Prettier, I thought it handy to wire up Webpack to process files with Prettier automatically. That way, my teammates would not need to install or remember the CLI, since the build step would simply automate this.",
  learned:
    "With this project, I learned a significant amount of how modern JavaScript plugin systems are architected and learned better how Webpack works to build a dependency graph and manage dependencies."

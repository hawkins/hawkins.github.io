  description:
    "A Hubot chat bot to mention every user in a GroupMe channel all at once.",
  motive:
    "At Mississippi State University, it's common for students to set up a GroupMe room for each class they're in to share announcements.<br/>Eventually, my friends and I wanted a way to easily tag all members of a chat room just like we could in Slack.<br/>With this bot, we were able to type just \"@all\" in any message to automatically tag all members of the group, excluding those in the configurable blacklist.",
  learned:
    'This is one of my most popular projects. I frequently receive emails about it, so I wrote a <a href="/post/groupme-at-all" target="_blank">blog post</a> to teach users how to install the bot.<br/>I targeted the bot for users without much programming experience, so I learned to write software guides accordingly.<br/>Additionally, this was a great experience to learn how some public REST APIs are operated via Node.js applications.'

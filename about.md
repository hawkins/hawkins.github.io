This is my personal tech blog. Here you'll find anything from hacky how-to's to commentary on a range of technical topics.

I'm an aspiring full stack developer with particular interests in Node.js, Python, and AngularJS. You can find me on GitHub [here](http://www.github.com/hawkins)!

Don't forget to [say hello](http://hawkins.github.io/contact/), I always appreciate any and all feedback!

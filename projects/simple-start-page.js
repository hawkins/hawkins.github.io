    "A very basic Google Chrome extension to replace the New Tab Page with a Google Calendar view and provide customizable bookmarks with a custom interface.",
  motive: `I wanted a more useful New Tab page in Chrome to help me keep track of my class and interview schedule, as well as provide a useful search bar and categorized bookmark collection.
<br/>
Simple Start Page was the answer, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-start-page/penpdmhpelafnfaeidigoapommfeoeai" target="_blank">a number of users agree</a>!`,
  learned: `Working at Textron Systems was my first exposure to web development.
<br/>
There I learned basic JavaScript and JQuery development, and had an itch to learn more about web dev.
<br/>
Simple Start Page was my first foray into the great world of web dev, and I used it to learn and practice concepts to help my work at Textron.
<br/>
Writing it also taught me a good deal about distribution and scalable design through a number of rookie mistakes.`

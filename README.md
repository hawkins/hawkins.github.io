# Hawkins Writes Code

This is the repo powering my tech blog.

It's written entirely in JavaScript and utilizes [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for server-side rendering with React.

If you're unimpressed, I wrote this in a bit of spare time between more fun and exciting open source projects, and mostly because I'm about to graduate and seek full time employment. I was perfectly happy with the old blog, but I figured a passionate web dev should at least make their own website as a demo, not just use a static site generator. Maybe that's silly, but this site serves to tick the box and not much more. It's simple, works, houses my blog, and that's about all I ever wanted from it. Feel free to look at my other projects if you're interested to see something cool or where my passion really shines!

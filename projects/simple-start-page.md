A very basic Google Chrome extension to replace the New Tab Page with a Google Calendar view and provide customizable bookmarks with a custom interface.

I wanted a more useful New Tab page in Chrome to help me keep track of my class and interview schedule, as well as provide a useful search bar and categorized bookmark collection.
Simple Start Page was the answer, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-start-page/penpdmhpelafnfaeidigoapommfeoeai" target="_blank">a number of users agree</a>!

    Working at Textron Systems was my first exposure to web development.
    There I learned basic JavaScript and JQuery development, and had an itch to learn more about web dev.

    Simple Start Page was my first foray into the great world of web dev, and I used it to learn and practice concepts to help my work at Textron.

    Writing it also taught me a good deal about distribution and scalable design through a number of rookie mistakes.

            A Python library to send and receive SMS for free by using Gmail, SMTP and IMAP gateways, with pip support and complete documentation.

            I needed a simple way to text my Raspberry Pi for a number of scripts and other projects. I had looked at other solutions like Twilio, but wanted a simpler and free method with intelligent responses based on regular expressions. Enter: Shawk!

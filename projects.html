        I spend a large portion of my free time learning new technologies for software engineering. Occasionally, this leads to a complete product or application I push out to the public. You can check out some of my more notable ones here.

        <h2><a href="/shawk/" target="_blank" class="nodec">Shawk</a></h2>
        <p>
            A Python library to send and receive SMS for free by using Gmail, SMTP and IMAP gateways, with pip support and complete documentation.

            I needed a simple way to text my Raspberry Pi for a number of scripts and other projects.
            I had looked at other solutions like Twilio, but wanted a simpler and free method with intelligent responses based on regular expressions.
            Enter: Shawk!
        </p>

            Writing Shawk taught me about creating more Pythonic code and objects. Additionally, this project taught me a great deal about how E-Mail is defined and operates.

        <h2><a href="http://hawkins.github.io/start-page/" target="_blank" class="nodec">Simple Start Page</a></h2>
        <p>
            A very basic Google Chrome extension to replace the New Tab Page with a Google Calendar view and provide customizable bookmarks with a custom interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted a more useful New Tab page in Chrome to help me keep track of my class and interview schedule, as well as provide a useful search bar and categorized bookmark collection.
            Simple Start Page was the answer, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-start-page/penpdmhpelafnfaeidigoapommfeoeai" target="_blank">a number of users agree</a>!

            Working at Textron Systems was my first exposure to web development.
            There I learned basic JavaScript and JQuery development, and had an itch to learn more about web dev.
            <br/>
            Simple Start Page was my first foray into the great world of web dev, and I used it to learn and practice concepts to help my work at Textron.
            <br/>
            Writing it also taught me a good deal about distribution and scalable design through a number of rookie mistakes.
